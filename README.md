# Java Sorting Algorithms

## Desrciption
This is a simple java console application that implements five sorting algorithms. These algorithms are bubble sort,
insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quicksort. In the AlgorithmsMain.java class you will see the logic behind the program and in the SortingAlgorithms.java class, you will see the implementation of these sorting algorithms.

## How to use
First you will need to clone the application to your computer in the desired location by running by running the following command: 
````
git clone https://github.com/elirailis/java-sorting-algorithms.git
````
Then once cloning of the application is complete, open your CMD and navigate to the folder. Once in that folder navigate to the dist file.
````
SortingAlgorithms\dist>
````
If you type the following command in your CMD.
````
SortingAlgorithms\dist>dir
````
You should be able to see the SortingAlgorithms.jar file. If so run the following command in your CMD to run the application.
````
SortingAlgorithms\dist>java -jar SortingAlgorithms.jar
